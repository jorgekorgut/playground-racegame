# playground-racegame

## Features

### Engine  
- Camera  
- Primitive Types (Planes, Lines)  
- Noise (Perlin)
- Entity Component System

### Game
- Chunk Generation
- Camera Control (Fly)

## Building

Dependency libraries
- GLFW (You need to install and specify PATH in CMake)
- GLAD (You need to install and specify PATH in CMake)
- ASSIMP (You need to install and specify PATH in CMake) Debug/Release Support
- IMGUI (Automatically installed)
- STB (Automatically installed)

charge all submodules
``` git pull --recurse-submodules ```

```mkdir build```  
```cd build```  

use CMakeGUI to configure and generate project files inside a build folder and specify the path to the dependency libraries.

## TODO

- Batch Rendering : Include all objects into a single vertex buffer and index buffer to reduce draw calls.
- Optmize Perlin Noise Call function. (GPU/CPU Parallelization).
- Add LOD (Level of Detail) for terrain.
- Add procedurally generated grass with wind effect.
- Add procedurally generated roads.
- Add the car model and implement car physics.
- Work on a better UI for the engine. (Add terrain parameters)
